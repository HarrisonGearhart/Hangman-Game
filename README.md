## Introduction
Welcome to the **Hangman Game**! This game is based off of the classic word game, Hangman, but with a travel theme!

## Game Instructions
- Pick between 3 different travel categories.
- Based off the category selected, a random word will be chosen and each character will be displayed with an underscore.
- At the same time, a keyboard will appear. This is where you will be guessing each letter of the word.
- Everytime you guess a letter, the letter will be greyed out, indicating that it has already been guessed.
- If the letter you pick is correct, the underscore associated with that letter will disappear and the letter will appear.
- If the letter you pick is incorrect, a body part will be drawn onto the hangman diagram.
- If you can guess the entire word before all of the hangman body parts are drawn, you win!!
